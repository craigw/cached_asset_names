CachedAssetNames
================

Caching is King as they say, but if you cache your static assets and deploy
new versions of them then some proxy servers such as Squid won't be able to
use Rails built-in cache busting to detect new versions.

This plugin rewrites stylesheet, image and javascript asset paths constructed
by Rails so that the proxies do detect new versions.

Example
=======

If you're using Apache you'll want to add something like this to your virtual
host configuration.

  # Rewrite the URLs this plugin creates to the actual files on disk.
  #
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteRule (.*)-v\d+\.(.*)$ $1.$2 [L]

  # Set the static assets to expire from client caches one year in the future
  #
  # Note that the HTTP RFC says that servers SHOULD NOT serve expires headers
  # for more than one year from access.
  #
  <FilesMatch "\.(js|css|png|jpe?g|gif)$">
    ExpiresActive On
    ExpiresDefault "access plus 1 year"
  </FilesMatch>

Beyond that you just need to have this plugin in your Rails vendor/plugins.
